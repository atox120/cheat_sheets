## 1. Prerequisites

1.  Raspberry Pi 4 + neccesary peripherals. 
2.  Micro SD card 

Herein we use a Raspberry Pi (RPI) 4 with 8GB RAM on a 64-bit architecture. We assume you have bought the neccesary peripherals including keyboard and mouse etc. 
Furthermore, you will need a micro SD card onto which you will load your boot volumne. 

## 2. OS Install

We will load a Ubuntu 20.04 LTS Focal server distribution onto our device. The steps are as follows:

1. Download and install the raspberry pi imager from this [link](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/)
2. Choose the Ubuntu 20.04 LTS server edition. 
3. Insert the micro SD card and select this volume as your target volumne. 
4. Start the disk write process - note this will permanantly delete any existing ffiles on the sd card. 

## 3. Setting up Ubuntu

Load the SD card into the Raspberry PI and turn it on.
